This project explores some manipulation of game objects
meant for use in Outlanders.

It reads in a data file generated by an old prototype with
sector data in it.

it exports that data in another form suitable for storage
in the Object Store. (flatSectorTable)

It will explore different aspects of work with game objects
in a variety of forms

Now the readFlatSectorTable.xml file offers some insight into the relative
time required to write objects one-by-one, all-in-one, or in groups of 64.

Probably it will suffice to simply maintain a memory map of the game state,
and then back the whole thing up to object store about every 3 minutes (a game phase)

mapWriter.xml - this has code that can generate a single 16x16 plot with random
values written into each sector.
