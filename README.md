# OOSv.1
Outlanders Object Service

This is a simple Mule app designed to experiment with
Dataweave 2.0, the object store, and a couple of other
things.

Its start simply works with the concept of sectors and plots.

It will also form the foundation of the message service, and
the game mechanics elements
