# OOSv.1
Outlanders Object Service (v0.2.190528)

This is a simple Mule app designed to experiment with
Dataweave 2.0, the object store, and a couple of other
things.

Its start simply works with the concept of sectors and plots.

It will also form the foundation of the message service, and
the game mechanics elements

It's probably not very interesting, but you are welcome to poke around.
